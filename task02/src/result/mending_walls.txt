something there is that doesn t love a wall 
that sends the frozen ground swell under it 
and spills the upper boulders in the sun 
and makes gaps even two can pass abreast 
the work of hunters is another thing 
i have come after them and made repair
where they have left not one stone on a stone 
but they would have the rabbit out of hiding 
to please the yelping dogs  the gaps i mean 
no one has seen them made or heard them made 
but at spring mending time we find them there 
i let my neighbor know beyond the hill 
and on a day we meet to walk the line
and set the wall between us once again 
we keep the wall between us as we go 
to each the boulders that have fallen to each 
and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
we have to use a spell to make them balance 
 stay where you are until our backs are turned 
we wear our fingers rough with handling them 
oh  just another kind of out door game 
one on a side  it comes to little more 
there where it is we do not need the wall 
he is all pine and i am apple orchard 
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines  i tell him 
he only says   good fences make good neighbors 
spring is the mischief in me  and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head 
 why do they make good neighbors  isn t it
where there are cows  but here there are no cows 
before i built a wall i d ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out 
and to whom i was like to give offense 
something there is that doesn't love a wall 
that wants it down  i could say  elves  to him 
but it s not elves exactly  and i d rather
he said it for himself  i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand  like an old stone savage armed 
he moves in darkness as it seems to me 
not of woods only and the shade of trees 
he will not go behind his father s saying 
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again   good fences make good neighbors

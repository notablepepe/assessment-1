congratulations 
today is your day 
you're off to great places 
you're off and away 

you have brains in your head 
you have feet in your shoes 
you can steer yourself
any direction you choose 
you're on your own  and you know what you know 
and you are the guy who'll decide where to go 

you'll look up and down streets  look 'em over with care 
about some you will say   i don't choose to go there 
with your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet 
you're too smart to go down any not so good street 

and you may not find any
you'll want to go down 
in that case  of course 
you'll head straight out of town 

it's opener there
in the wide open air 

out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you 

and then things start to happen 
don't worry  don't stew 
just go right along 
you'll start happening too 

oh 
the places you'll go 

you'll be on y our way up 
you'll be seeing great sights 
you'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights 

you won't lag behind  because you'll have the speed 
you'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead 
wherever you fly  you'll be best of the best 
wherever you go  you will top all the rest 

except when you don't 
because  sometimes  you won't 

i'm sorry to say so
but  sadly  it's true
that bang ups
and hang ups
can happen to you 

you can get all hung up
in a prickle ly perch 
and your gang will fly on 
you'll be left in a lurch 

you'll come down from the lurch
with an unpleasant bump 
and the chances are  then 
that you'll be in a slump 

and when you're in a slump 
you're not in for much fun 
un slumping yourself
is not easily done 

you will come to a place where the streets are not marked 
some windows are lighted  but mostly they're darked 
a place you could sprain both your elbow and chin 
do you dare to stay out  do you dare to go in 
how much can you lose  how much can you win 

and if you go in  should you turn left or right 
or right and three quarters  or  maybe  not quite 
or go around back and sneak in from behind 
simple it's not  i'm afraid you will find 
for a mind maker upper to make up his mind 

you can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space 
headed  i fear  toward a most useless place 
the waiting place 

 for people just waiting 
waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come  or a plane to go
or the mail to come  or the rain to go
or the phone to ring  or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a yes or no
or waiting for their hair to grow 
everyone is just waiting 

waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for friday night
or waiting  perhaps  for their uncle jake
or a pot to boil  or a better break
or a string of pearls  or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls  or another chance 
everyone is just waiting 

no 
that's not for you 

somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
you'll find the bright places
where boom bands are playing 

with banner flip flapping 
once more you'll ride high 
ready for anything under the sky 
ready because you're that kind of a guy 

oh  the places you'll go  there is fun to be done 
there are points to be scored  there are games to be won 
and the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning est winner of all 
fame  you'll be as famous as famous can be 
with the whole wide world watching you win on tv 

except when they don't
because  sometimes they won't 

i'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too 
games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you 

all alone 
whether you like it or not 
alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot 

and when you're alone  there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants 
there are some  down the road between hither and yon 
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on 

but on you will go
though the weather be foul 
on you will go
though your enemies prowl 
on you will go
though the hakken kraks howl 
onward up many
a frightening creek 
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak 

on and on you will hike 
and i know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are 

you'll get mixed up  of course 
as you already know 
you'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go 
so be sure when you step 
step with care and great tact
and remember that life's
a great balancing act 
just never foget to be dexterous and deft 
and never mix up your right foot with your left 

and will you succeed 
yes  you will  indeed 
 98 and 3 4 percent guaranteed 

kid  you'll move mountains 

so 
be your name buxbaum or bixby or bray
or mordecai ali van allen o'shea 
you're off the great places 
today is your day 
your mountain is waiting 
so  get on your way

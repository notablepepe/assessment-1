whose woods these are i think i know    
his house is in the village though    
he will not see me stopping here   
to watch his woods fill up with snow    

my little horse must think it queer   
to stop without a farmhouse near   
between the woods and frozen lake   
the darkest evening of the year    

he gives his harness bells a shake   
to ask if there is some mistake    
the only other sound s the sweep   
of easy wind and downy flake    

the woods are lovely  dark and deep    
but i have promises to keep    
and miles to go before i sleep    
and miles to go before i sleep

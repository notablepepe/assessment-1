when i see birches bend to left and right
across the lines of straighter darker trees 
i like to think some boy s been swinging them 
but swinging doesn t bend them down to stay
as ice storms do  often you must have seen them
loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
after a rain  they click upon themselves
as the breeze rises  and turn many colored
as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel 
soon the sun s warmth makes them shed crystal shells
shattering and avalanching on the snow crust 
such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen 
they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load 
and they seem not to break  though once they are bowed
so low for long  they never right themselves 
you may see their trunks arching in the woods
years afterwards  trailing their leaves on the ground
like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
before them over their heads to dry in the sun 
but i was going to say when truth broke in
with all her matter of fact about the ice storm
i should prefer to have some boy bend them
as he went out and in to fetch the cows 
some boy too far from town to learn baseball 
whose only play was what he found himself 
summer or winter  and could play alone 
one by one he subdued his father's trees
by riding them down over and over again
until he took the stiffness out of them 
and not one but hung limp  not one was left
for him to conquer  he learned all there was
to learn about not launching out too soon
and so not carrying the tree away
clear to the ground  he always kept his poise
to the top branches  climbing carefully
with the same pains you use to fill a cup
up to the brim  and even above the brim 
then he flung outward  feet first  with a swish 
kicking his way down through the air to the ground 
so was i once myself a swinger of birches 
and so i dream of going back to be 
it s when i m weary of considerations 
and life is too much like a pathless wood
where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
broken across it  and one eye is weeping
from a twig s having lashed across it open 
i'd like to get away from earth awhile
and then come back to it and begin over 
may no fate willfully misunderstand me
and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
not to return  earth s the right place for love 
i don t know where it's likely to go better 
i'd like to go by climbing a birch tree 
and climb black branches up a snow white trunk
toward heaven  till the tree could bear no more 
but dipped its top and set me down again 
that would be good both going and coming back 
one could do worse than be a swinger of birches
